# General description of the system  
The game is a turnâ€”based card RPG where human and AI players use cards to attack, defend, heal, and power up.  

### Main components:
- **Cards**: 12 types combined in an inheritance hierarchy (for example, `Attack_Spell_Card`, `Beast_Card').  
- **Players**:
- `Human_Player': User-controlled, saves statistics.  
  - `AI_Player': Automatically selects optimal moves via `count_best()'.  
- **Characters**: 3 classes (`Healer_Character', `Tank_Character', `Knight_Character') with unique abilities (shields, healing).  
- **Mechanics**:  
  - Mana and player lives.  
  - Character levels and multipliers ('Dmg_MLTPL', `Heal_MLTPL').  
  - Player interaction with cards ('Use_card()', `Eat_card()`,`Throw_card_out()`).
